# Apprentissage-par-transfert-Transfer-Learning-pour-la-segmentation-d-images
This report presents a comprehensive study of transfer learning applied to image
segmentation. We implemented and compared three pre-trained architectures: UNet with ResNet34, DeepLabV3 with ResNet50, and FCN with ResNet50. The
experimentation was conducted on a synthetic dataset of 500 images containing
three classes (background, circles, rectangles). Results show that U-Net with finetuning achieves an IoU of 67.35% and a Dice coefficient of 78.61%, significantly
outperforming non-fine-tuned models. This study demonstrates the effectiveness
of transfer learning in image segmentation and provides a detailed comparison of
performance metrics
